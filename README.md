# Word2Vec-Guided-Traversal-for-Knowledge-Base-Question-Answering
This project implements a knowledge base question answering (KBQA) system that performs graph traversal (e.g., BFS) from a starting entity, selecting promising paths based on Word2Vec-based cosine similarity scores between relations and the query, to find answer entities, with performance evaluated using the F1 score.
